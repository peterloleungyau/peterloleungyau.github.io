      <description>Hello, I am Peter Lo. I received my B.Sc. in Risk Management Science, and my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering, both from The Chinese University of Hong Kong. During my Ph.D. study, I worked in Bioinformatics, focusing on inferring gene regulatory network from gene expression data. After graduation, I worked as a Postdoc at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, where I worked on Chinese NLP.
I am interested in Artificial Intelligence, including Symbolic AI, Machine Learning and Natural Computing techniques.</description>
