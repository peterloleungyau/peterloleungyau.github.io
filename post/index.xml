      <description>A probability distribution of a random variable refers to the probabilities that the random variable takes various values. In the case that the random variable can take only countably many different values, it is called a discrete random variable. In this case, we can summarize the distribution by simply specifying the probabilities of the different values. In this post, we first look at a simple example to get an intuitive idea of distribution of discrete random variable, then talk about some related concepts such as conditional probability, independence of events and random variables, expected value and variance.</description>

      <description>Roughly speaking, probability describes how likely a certain event takes place, and probability distribution refers to how likely a random variable takes different values. In this post, we look at some examples to get an intuitive idea of probability, sample space, events, random variable and probability space.
Probability Probability is used to quantitatively describe how likely an event would occur. A probability is a number between (inclusive) 0 and 1, where a larger value means the event is more likely.</description>
