      <description>Roughly speaking, probability describes how likely a certain event takes place, and probability distribution refers to how likely a random variable takes different values. In this post, we look at some examples to get an intuitive idea of probability, sample space, events, random variable and probability space.
Probability Probability is used to quantitatively describe how likely an event would occur. A probability is a number between (inclusive) 0 and 1, where a larger value means the event is more likely.</description>
